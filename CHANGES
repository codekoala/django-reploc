0.1.0-pre2

- Fixed some JavaScript errors.  Some of the markers weren't being removed from
  the map properly when performing more than one radius search in the same 
  session.
- Moved the search results to be displayed above the map, keeping the driving 
  directions below the map.  This makes it easier for people to notice that 
  something happened.

0.1.0-pre1
